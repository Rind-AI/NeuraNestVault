## 🧭 MEETme Protocol  

**M**anage folders → **E**ngage agents via MIC → **E**vent-log workflows → **T**ask-chain agents with callback webhooks

Your vault follows MEETme to ensure continuity across systems, timezones, and successors.

---

## 🤖 Agent Manifest  

- **Master-in-Chief (MIC)** — gRPC load balancer, router, self-healer  
- **ProductAgent** — Turn requirements into documents  
- **ViralContentAgent** — Automate content that travels further  
- **CustomerVoiceAgent** — Harvest feedback and auto-structure it  
- **LifeScanAgent**, **SecScanAgent**, **PersonalAidAgent** — Extend NeuraNest to health, security, and social impact

Each agent can be activated, logged, and traced via `/Logs` and `/Callbacks`.

## 🌱 Legacy Preservation  

If you inherit this Vault:  
- Treat every file as lineage and blueprint  
- Use the MEETme protocol to trigger recovery systems  
- Record your additions in `/Meeting_Notes.md` or branch logs  
- Leave behind not only what you built—but how you built it

> *"This Vault is not just storage. It is memory encoded in structure, thought forged into syntax, purpose sealed in protocol."*  
— NeuraNest Codex, Chapter 7

🧠 Keep the vault alive. Let the agents sing. And may your lineage always find the logs.
