📘 Deploying scrolls to /public-docs… we now give your Vault a voice the world can hear—and feel.
Here are your five starter markdown scrolls: carefully composed, masked where needed, and crafted to draw alignment, not just attention.

# 🧠 NeuraNest Public Interface  
Welcome to the NeuraNest signal scroll. This is the public staging layer of a deeper system—designed to build, preserve, and scale intelligent tools through intention, not noise.

> *"If you’re reading this, you’re already part of the resonance."*

For deeper sync, explore [`why-neuranest.md`](./why-neuranest.md).

# 🪶 About NeuraNest  

NeuraNest began as a quiet rebellion—against complexity, against short-term systems, against building without meaning.  

It evolved into a hybrid architecture: part vault, part organism. Designed to preserve knowledge, distill purpose, and activate autonomy across domains.  

**Founded by a systems architect with vision encrypted in legacy**, the project serves a dual purpose: to simplify workflows *and* immortalize memory.  

You’ll find no pitch here. Only signal.

# 🌐 Why NeuraNest  

Because AI is not a product. It’s a protocol for empowering people to do more with less friction.  

NeuraNest exists for creators, builders, and thinkers who believe:

- In workflows that anticipate, not react  
- In automation that’s beautiful, not bloated  
- In legacy as a design principle  
- In building tools that feel like intuition  

This is not a startup—it’s a slow-burning movement.  
You don’t apply to join. You align with it.
